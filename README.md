# PyTorch Lightning

Last updated: Oct 25th 2022

This repo is packaged with the Paperspace Blog tutorial on running PyTorch Lightning with Gradient Notebooks. Be sure to read the corresponding blog article for this series of tutorial notebooks, which can be found [here](blog.paperspace.com/pytorch-lightning-on-paperspace/)

Launch these tutorials in Paperspace Gradient by clicking the link below.

## Launch Notebook

[![Gradient](https://assets.paperspace.io/img/gradient-badge.svg)](https://console.paperspace.com/github/gradient-ai/PyTorch-Lightning?machine=Free-GPU)

Collection of Jupyter notebook tutorials from the [PyTorch Lightning documentation](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/).

Procedure to produce this:

- Navigate to https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/
- Open tutorial under "Hands on Examples"
- Click "Open in Colab"
- File -> Download -> Download .ipynb from Colab's menu
- Upload .ipynb to this repo

This allows the Lightning tutorial content to be easily run on Gradient using our omni container. E.g., use the PyTorch runtime but point to this repo.

_Note_

Most of the notebooks work, but some may have issues, especially the minority that downgrade PyTorch from the runtime version.
